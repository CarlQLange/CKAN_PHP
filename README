CKAN API PHP Client

No external libraries are required to use the CKAN client, but in order to run tests, 
you need to install a couple of testing tools/libraries.

1) phpUnit is required to run the unit tests.  You can install this using pear by running:
	pear install phpunit/PHPUnit
	If you don't have pear installed, you will see an error.
	See: http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.0/en/installation.html for details.  

2) Composer is required to install Behat.  To install composer, you need to run:
	curl http://getcomposer.org/installer | php 
	in the root of the project.
	You may get an error saying that you need to disable detect_unicode to install composer.  If this happens, add
	detect_unicode=off to your php.ini

3) Behat is required to run acceptance tests.  Install Behat by running:
	php composer.phar install
	in the root of the project.

To run the tests from the command line run:

bin/behat
